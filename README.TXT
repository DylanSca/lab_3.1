It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.


Answers

1. a class diagram provides the methods and feilds like a plan of sorts while the object diaram iholds the values of an instance
2. perfeably at the begining of the project, you can change remove or addfeilds methods or the class itself
3. Cant really change it unless a method is given. 
4. private Instructor tutor;
5. hours.increment();
6. Once the minute object rolls over back to 0 call the increment method on hours object
8. you can only set the value to values under 6 anyting over will not open up when using the get method
9. its not gonna change becuase it is higher or greater too the set value
10. Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context
11: display.setValue(int 5);, the type is already established in the code
13: now we can get the same value as the set numberdisplay
14:0
15:! (4 < 5), !false, (34 != 33) && ! false
16:private boolean Test(){
        if(a>b){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
19 the order is diffrent
